npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/user-event

# E2E Testing
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test
```

### Day 3-4: CI/CD Pipeline (CRITICAL)
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Security Scan
        run: npm audit
  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Vercel
        run: vercel deploy
```

### Day 5: Monitoring Setup (HIGH)
```typescript
// Add to package.json
"@sentry/nextjs": "^7.0.0"
"web-vitals": "^3.0.0"

// Basic error tracking and performance monitoring
```
