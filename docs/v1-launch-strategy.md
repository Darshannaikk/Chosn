  const locationMatch = jobRequirements.remote || developer.location === jobRequirements.location;
  
  return (skillMatch.length / jobRequirements.skills.length) * 100;
}
```

**Goal: Prepare for real users**

#### Priority 1: User Experience
- [ ] Onboarding flows for both developers and companies
- [ ] Profile completion prompts
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing
- [ ] Performance optimization

#### Priority 2: Analytics & Monitoring
- [ ] Track key metrics (signups, matches, responses)
- [ ] Error monitoring (Sentry)
- [ ] User behavior analytics

## üéì Learning Questions for Founder

1. **What's your target market size?** (e.g., senior developers in US/EU)
2. **Do you have any warm connections** in hiring/recruiting to test with?
3. **What's your fundraising timeline?** This affects how aggressive to be
4. **Are you open to manual matching initially** to ensure quality?
5. **What's your risk tolerance** for launching with MVP vs waiting for more features?

## üí° Key Insights

**You're in a strong position!** The technical foundation is excellent, and you're much closer to launch than most startups. The main challenge is execution and go-to-market, not building the product.

**Focus on the core loop:** Developer signs up ‚Üí GitHub validation ‚Üí Company discovers ‚Üí Match created ‚Üí Communication ‚Üí Hire. Everything else is secondary for V1.

**Your GitHub integration is a major differentiator.** Most job boards rely on resumes. You can show actual code and contributions, which is revolutionary for developer hiring.

**Time to market is critical.** The remote work trend and AI-assisted hiring space is hot right now. Launch fast and iterate based on real user feedback.
