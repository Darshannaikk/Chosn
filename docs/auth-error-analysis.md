# Auth State Change Error Analysis ðŸ”§

## Understanding the Problem

### What Happened?
- [ ] **Identify**: Which method is missing from your AuthService?
- [ ] **Understand**: What does `onAuthStateChange` typically do?
- [ ] **Research**: How do different auth services handle state changes?

### Code Investigation
- [ ] **Compare**: Supabase auth vs your custom AuthService
- [ ] **Analyze**: What methods are actually available in your AuthService?
- [ ] **Identify**: Where the mismatch occurred

## Solution Approaches

### Option 1: Implement onAuthStateChange in AuthService
- [ ] **Design**: How would you implement state change listeners?
- [ ] **Consider**: What events should trigger state changes?
- [ ] **Think**: How to manage subscribers/callbacks?

### Option 2: Modify useAuth to work with current AuthService
- [ ] **Understand**: How your current auth flow works
- [ ] **Identify**: Where auth state is actually managed
- [ ] **Modify**: The useAuth hook to use existing methods

### Option 3: Use Supabase auth consistently
- [ ] **Research**: How Supabase auth.onAuthStateChange works
- [ ] **Decide**: Whether to switch to Supabase auth
- [ ] **Plan**: Migration strategy if needed

## Key Learning Questions
- [ ] **Why** doesn't your AuthService have onAuthStateChange?
- [ ] **How** should authentication state be managed in Redux vs auth service?
- [ ] **What's** the difference between imperative vs declarative auth state management?
- [ ] **When** should you listen to auth changes vs checking auth status?

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Choose your approach (1, 2, or 3 above)
- [ ] Implement the solution
- [ ] Test login/logout functionality
- [ ] Verify Redux state updates correctly
- [ ] Test page refreshes and auth persistence
