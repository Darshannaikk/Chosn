4. **GitHub Integration**: Viral loop when developers share profiles

### **Company Acquisition (Days 20-60)**

## üî• **Competitive Advantages**

- **Quality Focus**: Premium positioning vs mass market job boards

### **Market Timing**
- Remote work normalization
- Developer shortage continues
- AI/automation making skill assessment crucial
- Companies frustrated with traditional recruiting

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Risks & Mitigation**

### **Technical Risks**
- **Risk**: GitHub API rate limits
- **Mitigation**: Smart caching and gradual rollout

### **Business Risks**  
- **Risk**: Chicken-egg problem (need both developers and companies)
- **Mitigation**: Developer-first strategy, manual matching initially

### **Market Risks**
- **Risk**: Competition from established players
- **Mitigation**: Focus on GitHub differentiation and quality experience

## üéì **Founder Questions**

**Before proceeding, clarify:**

1. **Scale Ambitions**: Bootstrapped growth or VC-funded?
2. **Time Commitment**: Full-time on this or side project?
3. **Technical Skills**: Can you handle development or need to hire?
4. **Network**: Any warm connections in recruiting/hiring?
5. **Risk Tolerance**: Launch with MVP or wait for more features?

## üí° **Final Recommendation**

**You're in an enviable position.** Most founders spend months building what you already have. The technical foundation is solid, the market opportunity is real, and the timing is perfect.

**Your biggest risk is overthinking instead of shipping.** Launch with the core matching experience and iterate based on real user feedback. The GitHub integration alone will generate significant interest in the developer community.

**Focus on execution over perfection.** Get 50 quality developers using the platform, then approach companies with proof that you have what they need.

**The opportunity is yours to lose.** Ship fast, learn faster, and dominate this niche before larger players catch on.
